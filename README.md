## Overview

This project focuses on analyzing crop production patterns in India using Power BI. Data cleaning and preparation were essential steps, including handling missing values and formatting columns for accurate analysis. The study aims to identify key crop contributors, regional production disparities, and potential correlations between crop type, geography, and climatic conditions.

## Problem Statement

India's agricultural sector, a critical component of the economy, faces substantial challenges in ensuring food security and maximizing crop yield. The intricate interplay of climatic conditions, soil quality, water availability, and government policies significantly influences crop production outcomes. This project aims to address the need for a comprehensive understanding of these factors by analyzing historical crop production data. The study seeks to identify key determinants of crop yield, uncover regional production disparities, and develop insights to support evidence-based decision-making in the agricultural domain.

## Data Source

The dataset employed for this analysis is a CSV file encompassing crop production data across India from 1997 to 2015. Comprising 246,091 rows and seven columns, the dataset includes information on states, districts, crop type, season, production quantity, and area cultivated. To ensure data integrity, empty values within the production column were replaced with zeros, as these instances likely represent actual zero production rather than missing data. Furthermore, the year 2015 was excluded from the analysis due to insufficient data and an unusually low production average, which could potentially bias the results. Basic data formatting and cleaning were performed to prepare the dataset for subsequent analysis.

>[!Note]
>*Coconut production in India significantly dwarfs that of other crops, creating a disproportionate impact on visual representations. Including coconut data in visualizations would obscure trends and patterns in other crops, hindering comparative analysis. To ensure a balanced and informative representation of crop production across India, coconut data was excluded from some of the  visualizations.*

## Results/Findings

- Despite a declining agricultural area over the analyzed period, increasing crop production signifies a notable improvement in agricultural yield efficiency. This inverse relationship between area and production highlights the impact of technological advancements on crop cultivation during this timeframe.

- Dominant whole year coconut production accounting for 96.69% and overall it contributes the 92.08% overshadows seasonal crops due to its perennial nature and lower land requirements. Unlike seasonal crops that require annual planting and maintenance, coconut palms are long-lived and less demanding in terms of land use.

- Sugarcane emerges as the second most significant crop, contributing 2.79% to whole year production and 3.92% to the overall total. While less dominant than coconut, sugarcane is a key component of the kharif season, accounting for 44.03% of production and also demonstrating efficient land use.

- Coastal and tropical states and their districts, particularly Kerala, Andhra Pradesh, and Tamil Nadu, emerge as top agricultural producers due to their dominance in coconut cultivation. When excluding coconut, the focus shifts to tropical to subtropical states and their districts like Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra, which excel in sugarcane production, indicative of distinct regional crop specialization.
